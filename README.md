TODO

* when button clicked
  * open new tab showing corresponding WAF page (is that allowed)
* tweak button based on url
  * if not, hide/disable button
  * if it is enable button
* do we need to have popup.html - can it be done from the extension button alone

DONE

* how to debug - hopefully console.log works (it does). Also can right click on button to get inspect popup debug window
* check if url is an armory page
